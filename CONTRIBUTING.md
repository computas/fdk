# Contributing to the project

The project is a joint effort of several Norwegian governmental agencies and funded through the [Skate](https://www.difi.no/fagomrader-og-tjenester/digitalisering-og-samordning/skate) program.
The work is led by the [Brønnøysund Register Centre](https://www.brreg.no/home/). We are a small team and appreciate any help we can get. 

In the next phase we will focus on API descriptions and register our user stories as issues on github so that you can monitor our work.
